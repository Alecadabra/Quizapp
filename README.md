# Quizapp

An (unfinished) Firebase/Flutter Android app.

This is a super basic app that uses anonymous login on Firebase to authenticate
sending and receiving a user input string from Firestore (the database).

The name Quizapp comes from the 
[course](https://fireship.io/courses/flutter-firebase) I used to help make it.

This acted as a prototype to test the Firebase/Flutter stack for use in a
larger project.
